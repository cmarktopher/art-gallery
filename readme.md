# Art Gallery API

This repo contains all code for the Art Gallery API.

### Summary of Project

This project was initially created for an assessment task for SIT331 - Secure Backend Services at Deakin University. Now, it will continue in another assessment task for SIT315 - Concurrent and Distributed Programming where I will attempt to apply distributed and parallel programming logic to the current codebase.
